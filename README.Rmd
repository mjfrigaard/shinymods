## What's in `shinymods`?

`shinymods` contains a collection of modules (and helper functions) designed to make creating, using, and testing modules easier. I've intentionally kept all the modules minimal, without complex layout functions or additional dependencies, so their behaviors are more [predictable](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Principle_of_least_astonishment).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `shinymods` like so:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mjfrigaard/shinymods")
library(shinymods)
```
